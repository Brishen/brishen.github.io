## Background
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act):

The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (Pub.L. 107â€“252), or HAVA, is a United States federal law which passed in the House 357-48 and 92-2 in the Senate and was signed into law by President Bush on October 29, 2002. The bill was drafted (at least in part) in reaction to the controversy surrounding the 2000 U.S. presidential election, when almost two million ballots were disqualified because they registered multiple votes or none when run through vote-counting machines.

The goals of HAVA are:
- replace punchcard and lever-based voting systems;
- create the Election Assistance Commission to assist in the administration of federal elections; and
- establish minimum election administration standards.


HAVA mandates that all states and localities upgrade many aspects of their election procedures, including their voting machines, registration processes and poll worker training. The specifics of implementation have been left up to each state, which allows for varying interpretations of the federal law.
  
## HAVA requirements
### Reporting and Planning
- States must create a plan detailing how federal funds will be used, election education and training, and other things to be eligible for federal funds
- States must provide yearly reports for how they spent funds that year

### Accessibility
- Improves accessibility for the disabled to utilize their right to vote

### Voter registration
- States must create a single registered voter list that is regularly maintained

### Election Assistance Commission (EAC)
- Created the Election Assistance Commission, a bipartisan independent agency for assisting states manage elections

### Voter ID
- First time voters who registered by mail must show a form of ID such as an ID card or proof of residency

### Voting Systems
- Voters must be able to verify privately and independently their ballot before it is cast and counted
- Voters must have the opportunity to change/correct the ballot before it is cast and counted
- All systems must be auditable and produce a paper record that can be manually audited

### Provisional Ballots
- A voter who cannot immediately satisfy the requirements for voting (e.g. not on a list of registered voters) can cast a provisional ballot.

### Improved access for military and overseas citizen


## Recent legislation relating to the 2020 elections
In 2019, two bills were introduced into the House focusing on making our elections safer through securing election infrastructure:
* [HR 2722](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2722/text)
* [HR 3412](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3412/text)

## HR 2722

This bill expands on the HAVA with many provisions.

### Paper Balloting Enhancements
- Requires an 'individual, durable, voter-verified paper ballot' that must be able to be marked by hand and audited by officials without the use of a machine or other equipment
- These paper ballots will be kept as the official record of votes for recounts and audits, superceding the electronic count
- Must be suitable for manual recounts and audits
- Must be durable to withstand multiple counts by hand, and must last for 22 months
- Must be printed on recycled paper in the US (after 1/1/21)

In case the paper ballots have been compromised to such a manner that the outcome of the election could be changed, the remedy will be made in accordance with applicable State law, but that the electronic vote will not be used as the sole basis in determining the official result.

Additionally, the EAC will perform and study and submit a report on optimal paper and electronic/digital ballots no later than 1/1/20.

### Accessibility enhancements
- The NSF shall make grants ($5,000,000 total) to entities to study, test, and develop accessible mechanisms and devices for marking, verifying, and casting ballots, as well as create best practices
- These efforts would be focused on: individuals with disabilities, voters whose primary language is not English, and voters with literacy difficulties.

### Grants
- States will be granted funds to:
	- replace voting systems that do not meet the requirements
    - replace voting systems that do meet the requirements, but not the most recent voluntary voting system guidelines issued by the EAC
    - Improve voting system security
    - Implement and model bast practices for ballot design, instructions, and testing

These grants are, at a minimum, equivalent to $1 per voter in the past two federal elections (2016, 2018)

In order to be eligible for funds, states must:
- Describe how fund will be used
- Certify that funds will be used within 5 years

States are required to ensure that, to the great extent practical, voting systems should be replaced with a system that supports ranked choice elections

### Allowable improvements
- Goods and services from qualified vendors
- Cyber and risk mitigation training
- Risk and vulnerability assessments
- System maintenance
- Techincal support
- Enhancing IT infrastructure operations
- Voter registration cybersecurity

### What is a qualified vendor? 
- Owned and controlled by a US Citizen or permanent resident

### Responsibilities of a qualified vendor
- Discloses sources of goods and services sourced from outside the US
- Ensures their infrastructure is developed, operated, and maintained in accordance with cybersecurity best practices issued by the Technical Guidelines Development Committee
- Permits independent cybersecurity testing by the EAC and by the Secretary
- Reports cybersecurity incidents no less than 3 days after becoming aware

### Appropriations
- $600,000,000 for FY19
- $175,000,000 for FY20,22,24,26
- Continues until funds are exhausted

### EAC Modifications
- The Secretary of the DHS will have a seat on the board of advisors on the EAC
- The DHS will have a representative on the Technical Guidelines Development Committee
- The committee will be a geographically representative group

### Audits
- States must administer audits for all Federal office elections, unless they conduct a full manual recount
- A report must be published after the audit and at least 5 days before certification of the results
- Audit costs will be paid by the EAC
- The Government Accountability Office (GAO) will publish an analysis regarding the improvements made by the audits

### Voting/Counting machines
- Scanners must be mechanically incapable of modifying the votes on a paper ballot
- Scanners must be capable of exporting data in an open data format
- Scanners have hardware that:
	- Has had supply chain information provided to officials (and designated independent experts)
    - Has had source code, build tools, compilation options also provided similarly
    - Can be verified by officials, researchers, and voters to be running untampered software
- Waivers can be granted (on the Federal level) for a maximum of 2 years, must be public
- Scanners and ballot markers cannot use wireless communications, or use networking that can be concealed (e.g. powerline networking)
- Ballot markers cannot be capable of tabulating votes
- Ballot markers must be independently tested:
	- Have <5% chance of incorrectly marking ballots that are not noticed by a voter
    - With a diverse and representative pool of subjects, utlizing representative ballots
- Each state is required to apply for certification with the EAC no later than 18 months before an election
- The EAC will handle the testing of the machines by an independent entity
- The protocols and reports by the EAC will be submitted for approval by an independent review board of scientists
- Cretification fees will not be charged
- Previously certified equipment will be recertified before each election by the EAC
- Source code must be freely and publically available under a peretual, global license, except for commercial purposes
- Manufacturers must publically disclose the design of custom or altered hardware
- Voting machines must be manufactured in the US, applicable to the 2022 elections and beyond

States must also file a report before each election detailing the usage of electronic poll books and other equipment/systems.

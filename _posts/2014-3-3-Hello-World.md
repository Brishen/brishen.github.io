## Background
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act):

The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (Pub.L. 107â€“252), or HAVA, is a United States federal law which passed in the House 357-48 and 92-2 in the Senate and was signed into law by President Bush on October 29, 2002. The bill was drafted (at least in part) in reaction to the controversy surrounding the 2000 U.S. presidential election, when almost two million ballots were disqualified because they registered multiple votes or none when run through vote-counting machines.

The goals of HAVA are:
- replace punchcard and lever-based voting systems;
- create the Election Assistance Commission to assist in the administration of federal elections; and
- establish minimum election administration standards.


HAVA mandates that all states and localities upgrade many aspects of their election procedures, including their voting machines, registration processes and poll worker training. The specifics of implementation have been left up to each state, which allows for varying interpretations of the federal law.
  
## HAVA requirements
### Reporting and Planning
- States must create a plan detailing how federal funds will be used, election education and training, and other things to be eligible for federal funds
- States must provide yearly reports for how they spent funds that year

### Accessibility
- Improves accessibility for the disabled to utilize their right to vote

### Voter registration
- States must create a single registered voter list that is regularly maintained

### Election Assistance Commission
- Created the Election Assistance Commission, a bipartisan independent agency for assisting states manage elections

### Voter ID
- First time voters who registered by mail must show a form of ID such as an ID card or proof of residency

### Voting Systems
- Voters must be able to verify privately and independently their ballot before it is cast and counted
- Voters must have the opportunity to change/correct the ballot before it is cast and counted
- All systems must be auditable and produce a paper record that can be manually audited

### Provisional Ballots
- A voter who cannot immediately satisfy the requirements for voting (e.g. not on a list of registered voters) can cast a provisional ballot.

### Improved access for military and overseas citizen

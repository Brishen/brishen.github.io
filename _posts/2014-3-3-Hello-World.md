## Background
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act):

The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (Pub.L. 107–252), or HAVA, is a United States federal law which passed in the House 357-48 and 92-2 in the Senate and was signed into law by President Bush on October 29, 2002. The bill was drafted (at least in part) in reaction to the controversy surrounding the 2000 U.S. presidential election, when almost two million ballots were disqualified because they registered multiple votes or none when run through vote-counting machines.

The goals of HAVA are:
- replace punchcard and lever-based voting systems;
- create the Election Assistance Commission to assist in the administration of federal elections; and
- establish minimum election administration standards.


HAVA mandates that all states and localities upgrade many aspects of their election procedures, including their voting machines, registration processes and poll worker training. The specifics of implementation have been left up to each state, which allows for varying interpretations of the federal law.
  
## HAVA requirements
### Reporting and Planning
- States must create a plan detailing how federal funds will be used, election education and training, and other things to be eligible for federal funds
- States must provide yearly reports for how they spent funds that year

### Accessibility
- Improves accessibility for the disabled to utilize their right to vote

### Voter registration
- States must create a single registered voter list that is regularly maintained

### Election Assistance Commission (EAC)
- Created the Election Assistance Commission, a bipartisan independent agency for assisting states manage elections

### Voter ID
- First time voters who registered by mail must show a form of ID such as an ID card or proof of residency

### Voting Systems
- Voters must be able to verify privately and independently their ballot before it is cast and counted
- Voters must have the opportunity to change/correct the ballot before it is cast and counted
- All systems must be auditable and produce a paper record that can be manually audited

### Provisional Ballots
- A voter who cannot immediately satisfy the requirements for voting (e.g. not on a list of registered voters) can cast a provisional ballot.

### Improved access for military and overseas citizen


## Recent legislation relating to the 2020 elections
In 2019, two bills were introduced into the House focusing on making our elections safer through securing election infrastructure:
* [HR 2722](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2722/text)
* [HR 3412](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3412/text)

## HR 2722

This bill expands on the HAVA with many provisions.

### Paper Balloting Enhancements
- Requires an 'individual, durable, voter-verified paper ballot' that must be able to be marked by hand and audited by officials without the use of a machine or other equipment
- These paper ballots will be kept as the official record of votes for recounts and audits, superceding the electronic count
- Must be suitable for manual recounts and audits
- Must be durable to withstand multiple counts by hand, and must last for 22 months
- Must be printed on recycled paper in the US (after 1/1/21)

In case the paper ballots have been compromised to such a manner that the outcome of the election could be changed, the remedy will be made in accordance with applicable State law, but that the electronic vote will not be used as the sole basis in determining the official result.

Additionally, the EAC will perform and study and submit a report on optimal paper and electronic/digital ballots no later than 1/1/20.

### Accessibility enhancements
- The NSF shall make grants ($5,000,000 total) to entities to study, test, and develop accessible mechanisms and devices for marking, verifying, and casting ballots, as well as create best practices
- These efforts would be focused on: individuals with disabilities, voters whose primary language is not English, and voters with literacy difficulties.

### Grants
- States will be granted funds to:
	- replace voting systems that do not meet the requirements
    - replace voting systems that do meet the requirements, but not the most recent voluntary voting system guidelines issued by the EAC
    - Improve voting system security
    - Implement and model bast practices for ballot design, instructions, and testing

These grants are, at a minimum, equivalent to $1 per voter in the past two federal elections (2016, 2018)

In order to be eligible for funds, states must:
- Describe how fund will be used
- Certify that funds will be used within 5 years

States are required to ensure that, to the great extent practical, voting systems should be replaced with a system that supports ranked choice elections

### Allowable improvements
- Goods and services from qualified vendors
- Cyber and risk mitigation training
- Risk and vulnerability assessments

- Reports cybersecurity incidents no less than 3 days after becoming aware

### Appropriations
- $600,000,000 for FY19
- $175,000,000 for FY20,22,24,26

- A report must be published after the audit and at least 5 days before certification of the results
- Audit costs will be paid by the EAC
- The Government Accountability Office (GAO) will publish an analysis regarding the improvements made by the audits

### Voting/Counting machines
- Scanners must be mechanically incapable of modifying the votes on a paper ballot
- Scanners must be capable of exporting data in an open data format
- Scanners have hardware that:
	- Has had supply chain information provided to officials (and designated independent experts)
    - Has had source code, build tools, compilation options also provided similarly
    - Can be verified by officials, researchers, and voters to be running untampered software
- Waivers can be granted (on the Federal level) for a maximum of 2 years, must be public
- Scanners and ballot markers cannot use wireless communications, or use networking that can be concealed (e.g. powerline networking)
- Ballot markers cannot be capable of tabulating votes
- Ballot markers must be independently tested:
	- Have <5% chance of incorrectly marking ballots that are not noticed by a voter
    - With a diverse and representative pool of subjects, utlizing representative ballots
- Each state is required to apply for certification with the EAC no later than 18 months before an election
- The EAC will handle the testing of the machines by an independent entity

## [Reactions to HR 2722](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/bills/116/hr2722/statements)

### [U.S. Representative Bill Flores (R-Texas)](https://flores.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=401214)

> "Free, fair and secure elections are paramount to our democracy. Securing our elections should not be a partisan issue, yet the House Democrat Majority once again cut off all bipartisan efforts to address this issue as they push their hyper-partisan agenda. Earlier this year, the Democrat Majority passed their partisan election reform bill, H.R. 1, which ultimately mandates millions in taxpayer dollars to fund political races. The American public loudly rejected this attempt to federalize the states’ Constitutional responsibilities to administer our elections. In light of that rejection, House Democrats rolled out H.R. 2722, again on a partisan basis. This bill also proposes another federal election takeover of states’ voting processes, and even mandates the return to legacy paper ballots rather than allowing for the use of secure, auditable, 21st century voting systems.  One of the interesting parts of watching this process was watching House Members use our electronic voting system on a bill which would mandate the use of earlier centuries’ paper ballots – I had to chuckle to myself about the contrast of watching House Democrats moving voting processes backward while attempting to give federal bureaucrats control of our Constitutional right to vote. I voted against this bill because it fails to adequately address potential foreign interference in our election process, and it creates a federally mandated, top-down approach that completely ignores the Constitutional authorities of state and local governments. 

> "If House Democrats are serious about addressing election security and foreign interference, they should join Republicans to pass a bill which I support and have cosponsored, H.R. 3412, the Election Security Assistance Act. This balanced bill gives local election officials additional resources to secure elections while respecting states’ rights regarding voting processes."


### [US Representative Cathy Rodgers (R-Washington)](https://mcmorris.house.gov/my-votes-week-of-june-24/)

> 	H.R. 2722 was an entirely partisan bill that has [sic]


### [US Representative Mike Conaway (R-Texas)](https://conaway.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=399552)

> “Democrats in the House of Representatives continue to pour money into the wrong solutions for serious problems facing our nation. After forcing H.R. 1 through the House earlier this year, they are at it again with H.R. 2722. This bill does nothing to secure our elections, but instead wastes over a billion dollars from the taxpayers on hyper partisan federal mandates aimed at affecting election outcomes.

>“Our election infrastructure, over a decade old in many cases, is in dire need of significant upgrades. I am cosponsoring the Election Security Assistance Act, which builds off Republican efforts in the last Congress to provide necessary security improvements while maintaining the autonomy of states and local election officials. This legislation authorizes federal grants to states to help upgrade election systems, and provides security clearances to top election officials to better facilitate the sharing of sensitive election information.Critically, the Republican bill allows DHS officials to alert local state officials when they election system is under cyber-attack – something that is currently prohibited in current law and a provision that Democrats failed to put in their bill. It also creates new resources for election officials, including the first-ever Cyber Assistance Unit.

> “Injecting more mandates from the federal government and blindly spending money will not solve our election security problems. I hope my Democrat colleagues realize that, abandon yet another messaging bill that has no meaningful impact, and work with Republicans on real solutions to secure our election infrastructure before 2020.”
